# Result File Format & Location

This document describes the structure of the result files used for evaluating backtested strategies, and where to find them on disk.

---

## CSV File Format: `all_results.csv`

Each row in this file represents the outcome of a single strategy after backtesting.

| Column         | Description                                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| strategy_name  | Unique identifier for the strategy configuration|
| profit        | Total net profit from the backtest               |
| drawdown      | Maximum drawdown in percentage (%)                |
| winrate       | Percentage of winning trades                      |
| trades        | Total number of trades executed                   |

These files are usually generated by:
- `backtester.py` (Python)
- `ResultsLogger.mqh` (MT5)

## MT5 Output Location

When running backtests in MetaTrader 5 using the MQL5 modules, result files (such as `all_results.csv`) are saved to:

`MQL5\Files\Common\`

You can open this folder in MetaTrader 5 by:

1. Clicking `File` â†’ `Open Common Data Folder`
2. Navigating to `MQL5\Files\Common\`

This allows centralized logging and easy access to batch test results across all strategies.

## Usage in Evaluator

This file is consumed by the `evaluator.py` script to:

- Filter profitable and stable strategies
- Sort based on metrics such as profit and drawdown
- Export selected strategies to `filtered_results.csv`

---

## Example Entry

```csv
