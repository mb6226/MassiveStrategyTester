GitHub Actions CI/CD

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automate running the pipeline on each push to main or master.

- Workflow file path: .github/workflows/pipeline.yml
- Runs the full pipeline and uploads reports as artifacts
- Optionally publishes HTML reports via GitHub Pages

Setup

1. Ensure .github/workflows/pipeline.yml and requirements.txt are in the repository.
2. Push changes to GitHub.
3. Visit the Actions tab to monitor runs.
4. (Optional) Enable GitHub Pages via Settings > Pages selecting the gh-pages branch to serve reports publicly.

---

CLI and Web UI

- Run python PythonCore/cli.py for a terminal menu interface.
- Run streamlit run PythonCore/app.py for a web dashboard.
